# Lab 0 - Unix Toolbox

This is the README file for Lab 0.
It is written using [Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com),
which is a plain text format that's easy to write and displays
nicely on the web. [GitHub](https://www.github.com) natively
supports Markdown-formatted text, so you will see the nicely
formatted version of this file if viewed online. Opening in a
text editor (e.g., `nano`) will show you the raw Markdown text.
